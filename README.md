This repository has codes for my Computer Systems Security study. The list is as follows:
1. Implementation of Affine Cipher
2. Implementation of Playfiar Cipher
3. Multiplication of 2 polynomials using a given irreducible polynomial (GF(2^8))
4. To find primitive roots of a group <Zp*,x>
5. Implementation of RSA algorithm to provide 
  (a) Confidentiality
  (b) Authenticity
7. To implement Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm

#Procedure to run
Run the file "main.java" and type in the appropriate practical number.

#Output
I have attached pictures of my output to demonstrate the working of each algorithm after running main.java in command line. 
For compilation and execution, I used the IDE: "IntelliJ: IDEA". 


#Most of the values are not hardcoded, but for those that are, I have provided detailed documentation that can help understand limitations of each algorithm against certain test cases.
